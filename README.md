11. Verify migration successfully runs.
12. To start the application use the commands:
         npm run start-server - This starts the server portion of the application, enough to convert files via Postman
         npm run start-client - This starts the client that prompts the user various arguments to run the conversion, server needs to be running for this to work

Client portion will prompt you for the following arguments one by one:
  1. CSV input file name.
  2. JSON output file name.
  3. Whether headers are present in the CSV file (true/false).
  4. Whether the logger should log to console (true) or file (false).
  5. Whether logs should be saved to database (true/false).

To convert another file via client, the client can be stopped using Ctrl + C and launched again.

## Postman
Optionally, the file can also be passed to the application via Postman.

Using POST method for the URL `http://localhost:1337/upload?headers=<true or false>&&file=<file name to use>`.

Headers and name arguments are optional, headers will be set to false by default and a random default file name will be generated.

File will be saved in folder "filesInput" with the name that is passed as argument in URL and also converted file will be saved in "filesOutput".

After sending the file you will receive a response with a link you can download the converted file from.
